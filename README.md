# Cobblemon: Interact Wheel Additions

An open-source addon mod for Cobblemon which adds additional features for the Interact Wheel, written in Kotlin for
Fabric and NeoForge.

## Features

- Adds additional buttons to the Interact Wheel for both Pokemon and player interactions.
    - One is an alternative method for closing the menu without using Esc.
    - The other opens a new UI menu for reordering the options in the menu. Players can move the tiles around and change
      how the orientation of the options in the menus. The configuration is saved when the menu is closed.
- Added config for saving the above reordered options. This config data can then be shared or included with a modpack to
  provide a default or recommended option layout.
